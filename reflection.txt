Before taking this course I did not like front end at all, naively assuming html and css are not "interesting"
compared to the more "fancy" and "eye-catching" technical terms thrown around. I did not realize there 
is so much more to learn about the use of different tags and how to avoid redundancy and unnecessary css 
selectors through toggling checkboxes in the browser. I began to find joy in testing out different UIs and 
putting myself in the users' shoes. Small things like keeping the navbar visible as the user scrolls through
the menu so that they have the option to view the cart whenever they want, or having 
autocomplete name field in forms and displaying the ratings in stars and having checks to make sure the 
user does not submit an empty form are details I would normally never
have realized if I had not taken 132. 

I also got a better understanding of middleware pattern through OH and got inspired by Mario and Evelyn's 
method of testing the backend.
